Laravel and PHP Portfolio

Portfolio for coding with PHP and Laravel.

Here is the progress of my work so far. Each milestone I make learning, I will do my best to commit here. The result of this code can be found on: http://laravel.carlosvazquez.org/, until I'm ready to move t
o my main domain.

Other coding work can be found on my other GitHub repos, and my current Portfolio http://www.carlosvazquez.org/blog/category/Portfolio

As of Aug 1, 2015, I am looking for new career opportunities, specifically in the NYC area. You can contact me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pub/carlos-vazquez/b/67b/a50
